## Database Schema

### Measurement Structure

```sql
-- Primary measurement for sensor readings
CREATE MEASUREMENT sensor_readings (
  time TIMESTAMP,                    -- Primary timestamp index
  temperature FLOAT,                 -- Temperature value in Celsius
  
  -- Tags (indexed)
  sensor_id TAG,                     -- Unique sensor identifier
  zone_id TAG,                       -- Data center zone
  aisle_type TAG,                    -- 'hot' or 'cold' aisle
  equipment_type TAG,                -- Associated equipment type
  status TAG,                        -- 'normal', 'warning', 'error'
  
  -- Additional fields
  humidity FLOAT,                    -- Optional humidity reading
  battery_level INTEGER,             -- Sensor battery percentage

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

<Info>
**Database Performance**:
- **Write Throughput**: 100+ points/second sustained
- **Query Response**: < 100ms for typical queries
- **Storage Efficiency**: ~70% compression ratio
- **Retention**: 30 days raw + 5 years aggregated
</Info>

```sql
-- Optimized query examples
-- Use time range filters first
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT sensor_id, avg(temperature)
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE time >= '2024-01-01' AND time <= '2024-01-02'  -- Time filter first
AND zone_id = 'cold_aisle_1'                          -- Then tag filters
GROUP BY sensor_id;

-- Use appropriate retention policy
SELECT avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp
FROM "sensors"."downsampled_5m"."sensor_stats"        -- Use downsampled data
WHERE time >= now() - 7d                              -- For longer periods
GROUP BY time(1h), zone_id;
```
